	Earlier this year NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea announced the start of a new crime prevention strategy for the cityâ€™s troubled youth. The initiative was made to create a Youth Coordination Officer role in every precinct, similar to  Neighborhood Coordination Officers, to specifically build relationships with at-risk youth.

	According to the data collected by the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services, specific to youth justice data on arrests by county and region, the total number of juvenile arrests in Kings County, Brooklyn, NY., have consistently contributed to roughly 30% of the New York City total numbers between 2010-2018.
